description: " My name is Mongolmaa Gurbazar. I came from Mongolia eight years ago. I have a journalism degree in Mongolia. But because of the language differences, I'm not able to work here as a journalist. So I worked here as a caregiver and flip house on the side. I have done five houses so far. It's not as fun or glamourous as it looks on tv shows. It's endless tasks but at the same time, it's quite satisfying to see the progress. I like to read. Last year I made a goal to read 50 books. One book a week but I end up reading 30 books. I love reading plus it helps with my English. I try to be disciplined with my daily routine which is read two hours minimum, jump rope 45 minutes following up stretches, and 15 minutes of juggling balls. Yes, I like to juggle balls.",
